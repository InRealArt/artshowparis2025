The recipient of numerous international distinctions - a member of the Academies of Rome and Quebec, i-CAC certified, and listed on Artprice - her works are an ode to collective memory and a call to reinvent a more humane future. To acquire one of Monique Laville's creations is to embrace a committed and timeless art form."

      "words": "”Monique Laville paints with the soul, transforming each canvas into a window onto a world where past and present intertwine. Inspired by Impressionism, she reinvents forgotten traditions, bygone trades and vanished landscapes, while denouncing the excesses of our modern society. Her works, charged with emotion and symbolism, capture the essence of collective memory and the fragility of humanity in the face of industrialization. To acquire one of Laville's creations is to embrace an art that speaks to the soul, between nostalgia, commitment and timeless beauty.”",
